# Calculate the upper bound of possible circulating recombinant viruses

# Purpose
This pipeline is designed to estimate the maximum proportion of circulating recombinant viruses in a region by adjusting the observed proportion of recombinants by the abundance of each clade and the probability of observing a recombinant given the parent clades involved.

Values for the UK and USA at different thresholds for detecting a recombinant genome are hard-coded into the `main_ceiling_calculation.m` script
